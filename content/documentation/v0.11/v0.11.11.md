**Plugins**

* [Kubernetes (filter)](https://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.11/filter/kubernetes.html): new **merge_json_key** option. If merged json is to be included, this new option acts as a parent key for the new structured fields.
* [Kubernetes (filter)](https://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.11/filter/kubernetes.html): new **dummy_meta** option, when set the filter do not try to gather metadata from the API server, instead it just append a random record as meta. Useful testing and development.

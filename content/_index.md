# How to Conduct a Reference Check

## By Jeff Stump

### Overview

I wrote this document because I have seen the reference checking process slowly deteriorate over the last decade. By in large, it has become at best, a formality in the hiring process. Most companies go through the motions because they want to get a job filled and don’t dedicate enough time or ask the tough questions.   Bottom line, you can obtain large amounts of data if you establish trust with the person giving the reference and both ask the right questions, the right way, and most importantly listen carefully. Remember, you are just not looking for things that may rule out a candidate but also for things that will help you make important trade-offs among several candidates.  Moreover, what you learn should help ensure that the person you select will be positioned for success as great references should serve as a management tool in which a hiring manager can look to for help in on-boarding, further developing, and managing a candidate.

The following game plan will ensure success and happiness with your new hire!

### The reference list

When asking for a reference list, you should suggest that candidates provide a 360-degree list.  What does that mean? A great reference list includes peers, direct reports, and their bosses.  Better yet, I highly recommend getting a list of individuals external to their organizations. This would include customers, law & accounting firms, analysts, vendors, etc.). Speaking with this broader list of people should provide a more well-rounded view of how a candidate interacts with people at different levels within and outside the organization. Ideally, your goal in conducting references is to speak with individuals who have known and worked with the candidate for a long period of time and in different settings.

*Helpful Hint: Be proactive in asking for a reference list and its make-up. Don’t wait to see what is actually sent and have to say this is nowhere close to what you actually intended to receive.*

There is no rule for how many people should be called, however, it should be enough to establish patterns. That is patterns in behavior, accomplishments and failures.  In my experience, 6-9 references is a minimum. 2 bosses, 2 subordinates, and 2 peers along with some external references. - Note this does not include “off-sheet” references which I will get into later.

In asking for this list, you want to reiterate to the candidate that you would like a list of people that would best represent them in providing balanced references and that have enough experience working with them to be a meaningful reference. When looking to speak with specific folks for strategic reasons, Try to suggest ideas: “ How about the person you were reporting to when you were working at…” or “Who in your whole career would you single out as your best mentor?” or my personal favorite “Put together a list that defines who you are today.”

**Helpful Hint: In my experience, peer references can provide especially valuable input, because this is the place where relationships can be particularly complex.*

In general, a reference list says a lot about a person.  I have always considered this to be a meaningful representation of the quality of a candidate.  I liked to see people that worked for the candidate that are now successful VPs or CEOs that this person helped develop over the years. This is actually a noteworthy piece of information that should be included in the overall assessment of the candidate.

Generally, I like to tell the candidate who from our end is going to be following up with their references and how much time is going to be needed with each of them.   45 minutes is adequate. It sets the stage the right way and demonstrates that this process is going to be taken very seriously.

## Engaging with References

### Before the call

Adequate time needs to be allotted for a call.   When scheduling a call with a provided reference, clearly indicate in advance how much time you need as you don’t want to be rushed or having the reference ask half way through your call how much more time is needed.

### During the call

Set the tone for the call. You are in control of the reference call and you only have so much time to extract as much information as possible.  Outline how you are planning to spend the time with the reference and reconfirm that you want to make the most of the 45 minutes you have together. Taking control is important because you will find that sometimes references may spend too much time answering a particular question. It’s ok to politely interrupt someone by saying you got what you needed from that particular question and you are ready to move on to the next.

Establishing trust with each reference is very critical for getting answers that go below the surface. The person giving the reference needs to know that you are interested and invested in making sure this is a good fit and are not just looking for the “dirt” or make them feel like you already know the answer and are just looking for confirmation.

Ways to make this happen:

* You will need to spend time up front with the reference to introduce yourself, a bit on your background, and the firm or company you're with.   This is a great way to break the ice and though you’re clearly looking for specific information, you may find that references are more forthcoming when the process feels like a conversation versus an inquisition.
* Give the reference some context on what the reference call is about. Stage of your company, the role/position, charter of role, culture of your company etc.  Don’t assume the reference will know what the candidate’s interviewing for and bringing a reference up to speed might spare them some level of uncertainty and allow them to be more thoughtful in answering your questions.

 **Helpful Hint:  This is a good time to highlight topics you may consider to be an area of special interest. For example, “We are located in Pennsylvania (noting this will be a relo for the candidate as the issue) or “we are a very early start-up” if you have questions about the capabilities in joining a very young company. I find that references may naturally provide some insights based on this information without having to probe. “Wow they are joining an early stage company, interesting…”*

* Don’t feel like you are giving away too much information.  Because your questioning is going to be superb!

### After the call

A follow-up note expressing your thanks for helping in the process and that there may be follow-up.  Always keep a foot in the door.

Why is all this important? Lots of reasons…

* Accurate Data - Ensures, to the best we can do so, that we are getting the best data possible.
* Differentiate - No one does this anymore because it is more of a formality and usually rushed.
* Create Opportunities - Reference might be a future hire.

### Timing of Reference calls

By the way, references should be conducted throughout an interview process.  References checks should be taken before, during, and while wrapping up a process with a candidate.  Not just PRIOR to the making of an offer.  Do not wait until the very end of the process.  Think of referencing as an on-going process. With each additional meeting or engagement with a candidate, you should carefully be corroborating and measuring what you have been hearing from references along the way. It goes without saying but discretion is key. You can’t expose someone that is gainfully employed (see back channel referencing below).  

One clever way to do this without risk of exposure is to simply ask the candidate if they know certain people during the interview. People that you might know in common for example. If interested in pursuing the candidate, suggest it would be great to talk with some of these folks as initial references…don’t ask…they will tell you if they are uncomfortable.

Reference Strategies and Questioning:

When you move into questioning, think of what you are asking in the context of the information you are trying to extract from the reference.  During a reference call it is easy to get swept up into a conversation and not confirm some of the most basic facts. Moreover, you don’t want to spend the whole time doing simple fact checking.  Thus, it is a good balance between these two data sets.  Think of your questions yielding two data sets:

#1 Basic facts – Consider these the "basics" - confirmation of their relationship with the candidate, how long the worked together, track record, titles held, skills, and competencies, including information about the role the candidate played within the organization, specific responsibilities, and performance; and

#2 Qualifying facts – This is what I refer to as the "hows". The tangible examples of not what they did but how they actually did it.   These data sets allow you to better understand the candidate’s management and communication style, track record, and both strengths and areas for improvement, including more qualifying questions about their style, interpersonal skills, and approach to getting things done

**Helpful Hint: A great questioning strategy embraces a lot of redundant questions asked in different ways.  It’s ok for the referee to say “I feel like a broken record on this point.”  In fact, sometimes I ask if they could repeat an answer to a previous question at the end of the reference because I “accidently” did not get my notes taken down the right way. Pick a question that was not answered thoroughly or one that did not simply sound right. Test to see if the answer was consistent.*

## Have a strategy going into the call

Know your audience. There is nothing worse than going into a reference call without having some historical context of the relationship or where they might have worked together unless you like sounding like an idiot. Do some homework on the individual before you call them.  Use LinkedIn to find out who they know that you may know.  This will establish a connection with the reference, serve as an icebreaker and lower the guard.  An advanced referencer will leverage this knowledge in getting additional references.  “I saw that you worked together with Bob at the same company during the same period of time, would he know of the candidate?”

Carefully plan the areas to be covered in the reference call, including special areas of importance to the hiring manager that should be probed. Use questions raised during the interview process.  Also don’t forget to leverage your notes taken during the interviews.

### During the call

When listening to the reference, it is super important to listen not just to the overall comments a reference makes, but also to the specific word choices and the body language/tone with which the reference describes the candidate.

Tell-tale signs are:

* Comments that seem unclear
* Shifts in tone, long pauses, or hesitations
* my personal favorite which is the overly enthusiastic reference without sufficient depth of examples to back up the praise

When this happens be sure to ask a follow-up question to confirm your suspicions. Be willing to follow up, and, most importantly, probe the referee.

For example, if a referee is vague or unresponsive… Ask why they are being vague or unresponsive in a light hearted way. Do not be dogmatic.

Reintroduce the questions in a positive way: “This will help us ensure the transitioning of XX… is successful and help us understand how to best manage / support him in his new role”

“How can his next employer best manage him?”

“How can we help this person be most successful?”

If you determine the referee can’t help, is vague or unresponsive, use this time to find out other things that might be helpful in your reference process. For example, starting asking questions around the organization structure they have and how did the candidate fit into the organization. Ask questions that would include factoids on specific accomplishments the candidate noted in the interviews.  For example, “XX mentioned he was involved in developing that new product that was recently announced, sounds like it is going to be a big hit, who managed that project and did XX have an important role in the project?”

**Helpful Hint: Sometimes silence is a great strategy with a vague referee.  Don’t feel the need to jump in when they are done talking. Generally I feel that they will fill in the blanks eventually to fill the void.*

Generally, when this happens consistently through-out a reference call I cut things off and politely move on to shutting down the reference call.  There is no time to waste if you feel what you’re getting is not real information.

How do you start questioning?

A number of sample questions are listed below. You definitely want to tailor questions to specific areas you’d like to probe.  Though it is helpful to have a great all-knowing list of questions in your possession and other written prompts ready as necessary, reading directly from a list of questions may set an unnecessarily formal tone. Do your best to make the person giving a reference feel as though he or she is having a natural, flowing conversation.

Transitioning into questioning and engaging the referee

I suggest opening the conversation as follows:

“Please tell me a little bit about yourself and how you know XX? Then ask what the referee’s relationship to the candidate is/was, and get actual positions at the time that they worked together.  Get enough information to understand how the referee has interacted with the candidate. Keep in mind the referee’s relationship with the candidate to put the call in the proper context and frame of reference.

General Impressions

Ease into getting their general impressions of the candidate.  I call this the “data dump” of the reference.

I recommend some very general questions like “How would you characterize your experience working with XX?”

Allow the referee to talk free form for a period of time.  This is an important beginning phase of the reference. 

*Helpful Hint:  If the referee is not very focused or struggling; help by getting an immediate reaction, spontaneous comments first: Try to extract 1 word or 3 word descriptions of the candidate: “If you were to describe the candidate in three words, what would they be? “When you think of the candidate, what would be the 3 qualifiers that first come to your mind”? “What phrases come to mind when you think of this person?*

Write down as many of these qualities as possible.  My experience has led me to believe that during this period of the reference call is when you will get the most valuable input.  That is, these are the candidate’s qualities/characteristics that are most strongly impressed by the referee.  Use this data in a way to personalize and more importantly validate what the referee said later on in the call.

For example, “You mentioned in the beginning of our call that the candidate is very strategic. Tell me how they were strategic?” “Was the OEM deal they put together during this period a representation of being strategic?”

This strategy will confirm experiences given by the candidate; it reconfirms facts given by the referee to ensure consistency.  This is a helpful strategy if you have spotted inconsistencies in the resume, have doubts on some dates, or have a flakey referee.

How do you keep questioning?

Keep in mind what you are trying to validate and what your strategy was coming into the call.

Be crisp.  Keep your strategy of what you are trying to obtain in front of you to drill down on relevant points.

Make sure your questions are “open-ended” questions.  Do not lead the referee or ask questions in such a way that it puts words in the referee’s mouth.  Use phrases like “How would you describe…?” “Could you comment on…?”

Zero in on the most important areas (behavioral competencies, technical skills and knowledge, personal characteristics, etc.) and drill down.  Ask for examples to support the comments made (positive or negative input), particularly in the most important areas being covered.

Personality: overall impression, character, integrity, energy level, intellectual efficiency, communication skills, leadership, commitment…

Management abilities / Interpersonal skills:  ask, “How does he gain trust and respect from people around him?”  “How does she react under pressure”  “Has a conflict situation ever arisen?  How did he handle it?”

Strengths and weaknesses:  don’t ask for weaknesses!  Rather ask “What are the areas where XXX will need support and guidance”  “What are the aspects which one needs to consider in facilitating integration into the company?”

Suitability for appointment:  come back to your key focus areas. Ask “Our company needs someone who will achieve …(describe job’s challenges):  how do you see the candidates in relation to this job?”

Personal Interests: “How does a candidate balance his or her life?”  I really like asking these questions as they lead to some interesting answers…

Cover developmental areas in every call.

Explain to the referee that one of the important purposes of the call is to be able to give feedback to the hiring manager to ensure smooth transition. Some good questions along these lines might be:

* “If you were to give some advice to the [hiring executive], what might you share with him or her to help ensure the right fit and success?”
* “What do you think the candidate needs in order to assure success?”
* “What do you think are the primary drivers for the candidate – what motivates him/her?”
* "Who should we consider supporting or surrounding him or her with to ensure success?"

Other suggested approaches:

* “What would you see as possible developmental areas for the candidate?”
* “Leadership is a craft, not a destination, and we are all learning each day.  If you could provide the candidate with some confidential feedback/coaching, what would that be?”
* “What are some areas for improvement that you have seen the candidate take on and address, and in what ways did he/she address them?”
* “Are there any ways that the candidate needs to be bolstered to ensure his/her success?”
* “As the candidate’s boss, what were some areas that you counseled him/her from a developmental standpoint?”
* “What might the candidate have done to produce even better results or an even better outcome?”
* “What would his / her detractors say about this person?”
* “What advice would you like to share with his future boss to ensure he/she is adequately managed and receives appropriate support?”
* “Is there anything else we should know?”
  
If areas of concern come up in the referencing, be sure to get the input of other referees on these same issues for further corroboration.

Examples of additional questions you might want to ask:

* “Would you hire/work with the candidate again?”  Get the referee to elaborate if no. 
* “If you had a personal stake in this situation, would you recommend this person?”
* “Do you remember what your first impression was the first time you met with this person?  Was that first impression confirmed later on?”
* “Was this person a “star”?”
* “How would you rate him/her overall on a scale of 1/10?”

Closing the reference call

Ask, “Do you think we covered all the relevant points or is there anything else you wish to mention that would be relevant to that position?”

Don’t forget to say thank you!

Don’t wait to analyze what you’re hearing:

I like to ask myself this question after each reference call. Can you trust the references you got?  Think back to your own impressions through the referee’s tone, voice…

You might need to cross check a reference through additional reference checks if you still have doubts.

You should worry about divergent references if they are given by people at the same level (e.g.: all superiors)

If a red flag comes up through references, crosscheck.

Be sure to get balanced references. Are we getting a balanced view of this person?

Discriminate between incompatibility of personalities/styles and professional and performance issues.

If one reference is negative or when doubts are thrown up, crosscheck with other references to try to get an objective picture of the candidate.  Don’t rely on one judgment only!

### Conducting Back Channel References

This is an extremely important part of any reference process. Generally speaking, it is not acceptable to call people without the consent of the person being referenced.  However, there are ways around this. One strategy is to simply tell the reference that you may get referred to other people that you may want to call as a reference and ask them if it’s ok to do so without their knowledge.  At the end of the day, what are they going to say? No? If they do say no we know we will have a potential issue.  At least this will give the candidate an opportunity to say that it will not be positive.  Generally, people like to say, “Sure, I’m an open book.”  At that point, we received our hunting license.

Early in this document, I referred to asking candidates during the interview if they knew certain people and got their blessing then.  Who knows whether or not that person would have been a named reference anyhow but you are still getting a jump on things.

## Making some “cold” calls

As a rule of thumb when calling a “cold” referee, start-off by introducing yourself and your company.  Clearly state that you are calling them as a “blind” or non -referred reference and ask them whether or not they would feel comfortable taking the call.  In my experience, this courtesy pays a lot of dividends. Tell them that they will be taken into confidence and that the candidate is not going to be made aware of the conversation unless they are ok with it.

I would like to see every reference audit completed to contain somewhere between 25-50% backchannel references.  Think of it this way: 2 provided & 1 back-channel Boss, 2 provided & 1 back-channel peers, 2 provided & 1 back-channel subordinates.

### Documentation

Get things documented as soon as possible. Time does not make documenting a reference better.  Get it out of your head, on paper, and off to the hiring manager. Document an overview and support it with the details or examples.

Jeff Stump’s “DON’Ts” of Referencing:

Don’t:

* Forget to make references an important part of your recruiting process.
* Forget to proactively get well defined, 360 reference lists.
* Go into a reference call unprepared.
* Ask “closed-end” questions.
* Feel like you have to fill a void in the conversation.  The person on the other end will – often in very revealing ways.
* Ignore getting back channel references.
* Rush the referee.  Let the referee know up front about how much time you will need, and reschedule if he/she does not have enough time.
* Fail to listen and to pay attention to what you are hearing.
* Sound like you are reading the questions from a checklist.  Be conversational and follow the flow of the call, using a general guide to be sure that you have covered everything that you want to cover by the end of the call.
* Be afraid to pause for a minute to write down what you are hearing.
* Forget to document your references quickly.

### More reference questions:

* Tell reference:  We are trying to assess if the individual is good for this opportunity – whether his or her talents would be utilized in this situation – not if the candidate is good or bad.
* How long have you known the candidate and how did you come to know him/her?
* What was your relationship and for how long?
* How would you describe the candidate from a professional viewpoint?  From a personal viewpoint?
* What did he/she accomplish during the period you know him/her?  How did he/she accomplish it – soloist, team player, etc.?
* What was the condition of the business before and after his/her arrival?
* What did the candidate fail to do and why?
* What are his/her professional strengths?  What are his/her developmental areas, given that everyone has some?
* Describe the candidate’s relationship with bosses, peers, and subordinates.
* Describe the candidate’s management philosophy and style.
* What type of culture would the candidate work best in?  What kind of culture would he/she have a problem with?
* What are the person’s key personal values?
* If anything would trip up this person, what would it be?
* Would you hire the candidate in a position requiring what I’ve described to you?  Would you be concerned?
* If you were my client, what would you want to know about the candidate?
* What makes you think this person is a leader?
* To make him/her most successful over the first six months in the new position, in what areas would you provide support?
* How does the candidate react under pressure?  Give example(s) of impatience.  What are signs that things are not going well?  How can one better manage this situation?
* Other people you can recommend who would be good reference sources, such as bosses, peers, and subordinates.
* What makes you think this person’s a leader?
* What’s the best thing you are going to hear about this person? The worst thing?
